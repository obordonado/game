##>>>> Pokemon Game !<<<<
> For this game, I've used HMTL, CSS and JAVASCRIPT VANILLA

>It's coded using "display:none" in order to have a unique html file, but giving the sensation of 4 different screens.
The game is designed to be played full screen. (Press F11 on your keyboard)<br>
------------
>Methods "Attack" and "Heal" do their job depending on the initial stats of the selected player.<br>
The player may have (if it's lucky) more life than it has on its original stats, when using the "heal" ability, which uses Math.random (as does the "Attack") to assign its new value depending on the original value.
